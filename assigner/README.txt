Going to need custom script to connect website roster with teamspeak.
The idea is to assign new ranks, and remove old ranks for promotions.
This code/script will be used as an exmple for our roster system script.
In theory, we can use this script to add users to more than one server group.
Such as Medics, 501st, Razor Squad, etc...
